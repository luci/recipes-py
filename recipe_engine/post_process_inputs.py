class Command(list):
  """Specialized list enabling enhanced searching in command arguments.

  Command is a list of strings that supports searching for individual strings
  or subsequences of strings comparing by either string equality or regular
  expression. Regular expression elements are compared against strings using the
  search method of the regular expression object.

  For example, the following all evaluate as True:

    'foo' in Command(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])
    re.compile('a') in Command(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])
    ['foo', 'bar'] in Command(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])
    [re.compile('o$'), 'bar', re.compile('^b')]
         in Command(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])

  You may also provide a literal `Ellipsis` in the list to mean "zero or more
  tokens here" to allow matching commands with gaps between matching parts.

  For example, this would return True:
    ['foo', Ellipsis, 'bar'] in Command(['foo', 'monkey', 'stuff, 'bar'])
    ['foo', Ellipsis, 'bar'] in Command(['foo', 'bar'])

  TODO(iannucci): when recipe engine is in python3, update this to specify `...`
  instead.
