  All yielded configs will be consistent; configs are produced by
  creating partial configs based on varying a single top-level pin and
  successively updating the config with the commits for each other
  top-level pin that are consistent with the partial config.

  If the incoming config is consistent, all yielded configs will involve
  at least one "interesting" commit being rolled, where "interesting"
  means "the commit modifies one or more recipe related files", and is
  defined by CommitMetadata.roll_candidate. If the incoming config is
  not consistent, then some configs may be initially yielded that do not
  roll any "interesting" commits.

  Configs are yielded in increasing order of the commit movement across
  all repos, with new deps and backwards rolls being considered larger
  movement than advancing an existing pin any amount.

  As a tiebreaker, the commit with the lowest commit timestamp will be
  picked. So if two repos cause the same amount of global commit
  movement, the "older" of the two commits will roll first. Clearly this
  is best-effort as there's no meaningful enforcement of timestamps
  between different repos, but it's usually close enough to reality to
  be helpful. This is done to reflect a realistic commit ordering; it
  doesn't make sense for two independent dependencies to move such that
  a very large time gap develops between them (assuming the timestamps
  are sensible). All that said, the precise timestamp value is not
  necessary for the correctness of the algorithm, since it's only
  involvement is a tiebreaker between otherwise valid choices.

  Args:
    recipe_deps (RecipeDeps) - The recipe deps object.
    commit_lists_by_repo (dict(str, CommitList)) - Mapping from repo
      name to the commits for the repo. This will be updated as new
      repos are added.

  Returns:
    A generator that yields pairs of config objects. The config objects
    are mappings from repo name to the revision for the repo. The
    configs will include all repos that should be set in recipes.cfg,
    not just those that have changed. The first element is the currently
    accepted config and the second is the candidate config. The caller
    should send a boolean value to the generator indicating whether the
    config was accpted or not, which will affect how subsequent configs
    are generated. Any value sent before the first yield will be
    ignored.
