class ResourceWaiter(object):
  """Represents the machine's CPU, memory, disk and network as limited
  resources.

  Each cpu (according to multiprocessing.cpu_count()) is worth 1000 millicores.
  Every subprocess that attempts to execute will first acquire its estimated
  amount of millicores before launching the subprocess. As soon as the
  subprocess completes, the held millicores are put back into the pool.

  Similarly, memory is measured in megabytes of physical system memory (i.e. not
  including swap). The assumption is that the recipe (and its subprocesses) is
  really mostly the only thing running on the machine anyway.

  Disk and net are different, however. They are unitless measures of 'percentage
  of resource', where the absolute quantity of Disk (IOPS, read/write/seek
  speed) and Network (bandwidth, latency) are not considered. Consider them more
  a declaration that a given step contends on disk or network availability. If
  you had many steps which each took `10%` disk, only 10 of them would run at
  a time. Similarly, if you had steps which declared 50% of disk bandwidth
  usage, only 2 of them would run at a time.

  Because recipes are finite both in runtime and number of distinct steps, this
  resource class unblocks other processes greedily. Whenever a subprocess
  completes, this analyzes all the outstanding subprocesses and will unblock
  whichever ones 'fit' in the now-freed resources. This is done in roughly FIFO
  order (i.e. if two tasks could potentially fit, the first one to block will be
  chosen over the second to unblock first).

  This is different than what's deemed 'fair' in a typical scheduling scenario,
  because in a mixed workload, heavy tasks could be forced to wait longer while
  small tasks use the CPU. However, because the recipes typically run with
  a hard finite timeout, it's better to use more of the CPU earlier than to
  potentially waste time waiting for small tasks to finish in order to schedule
  a heavy task earlier.
