class StepPresentation(object):
  """StepPresentation allows recipes to alter the presentation of their recipe
  step in both the Buildbucket Build message, as well as it's visual
  presentation on e.g. ci.chromium.org (i.e. 'milo' UI service).

  You can obtain a StepPresentation object after running as step like:

     result = api.step(step_name, ['program', ...])
     presentation = result.presentation  # StepPresentation

  Your code has read/write access to the properties of this StepPresentation
  until it is `finalized`. Finalization happens when either the next step in the
  same greenlet (aka "Future") is started, or when the current greenlet or 'nest
  step' (i.e. `with api.step.nest(...):`) exits.

  The following step properties are available:

  # logs
  Logs are line-based text (utf-8) data. Steps, by default, have a `stdout` log
  which contains the combined stdout+stderr of the subprocess run in the step.
  Steps which use `stdout=(...)` or `stderr=(...)` will not see this information
  present on the step (that is: the recipe engine does not `tee` these outputs,
  just redirects them to the placeholder files).

  Logs is a map of `log name` (str) to `log data`. Log data can be a str, bytes,
  or a list of str or bytes. If given in list form, the items in the list are
  treated as lines separated by "\n". So, `'hello\nworld'` and
  `['hello', 'world']` are identical log data.

  If log data is bytes (or a list containing bytes entries), the bytes entries
  will be formatted as utf-8 using `errors='backslashreplace'`. We use
  backslashreplace as the most useful scheme. It will not let the reader
  distinguish between '\x1b' and r'\x1b', but typically this is the output from
  e.g. test commands where it is possible to distinguish based on context.

  If users want to use a different utf-8 encoding of the raw data, they
  can do so in their recipe.

  # status
  Status represents the overall status of this step, which directly impacts how
  it is rendered on the UI. For legacy reasons, there is currently a mismatch
  between the values of `status` and the values that Buildbucket uses in the
  Build message.

  The mapping is (status value, Buildbucket enum, default UI color):
    * 'SUCCESS'    SUCCESS        green
    * 'WARNING'    SUCCESS        green   # see crbug.com/854099
    * 'FAILURE'    FAILURE        red
    * 'EXCEPTION'  INFRA_FAILURE  purple
    * 'CANCELED'   CANCELED       blue

  NOTE: 'WARNING' is a valid value, but does not do anything differently than
  'SUCCESS'. The best way to implement warnings, currently, is to use
  `step_text` or `step_summary_text` to describe what is wrong.

  # had_timeout
  If True, indicates that this step timed out in some way.
  Has no functional effect on the presentation of the step, but can be used by
  your recipe code to see if the step ended due to a timeout.

  # was_cancelled
  If True, indicates that this step was canceled (i.e. an external non-timeout
  event happened which caused the recipe engine to terminate the step). This can
  happen when your recipe code explicitly uses the `Future.cancel()` function
  from the `futures` module, or if an external process sent the recipe engine
  SIGTERM/CTRL-BREAK while the step was running.

  # properties
  Properties are a way to export structured data from the OVERALL recipe. For
  very legacy reasons, these are attached to StepPresentation, rather than
  having a singular API for the overall exported data. See crbug.com/1409983.

  Recipes stream their output properties; Buildbucket users who observe the
  Build will see properties show up on the overall Build roughly as soon as the
  StepPresentation finalizes.

  Property keys here correspond to the TOP LEVEL output property key of the
  whole Build. If multiple steps emit the same output property key, only the
  lastmost step (i.e. the step which was finalized last) will have its value
  preserved. There is no merging or combining of values.

  For example:

      api.step('one', ...).presentation.properties['propname'] = [1000]
      api.step('two', ...).presentation.properties['propname'] = ["hi"]

  An observer of this build would see the Build output properties look like:

      {"propname": [1000]}  # after `one` finalized
      {"propname": ["hi"]}  # after `two` finalized

  Effectively, output properties are "write only". This was a (likely
  misguided) attempt to prevent recipes from using output properties as a way to
  pass state in-between otherwise unrelated pieces of code as a sort of global
  variable.

  # tags
  Tags are arbitrary key/value string pairs which can be set that will apply to
  THIS step only, are rendered in the UI, and are also exported via the
  Buildbucket API. They are intended as a way for EngProd teams to annotate
  individual steps with stable identifiers and/or to report a bit more
  information about this specific step, without needing to resort to parsing the
  summary_markdown field.

  Tag keys should indicate the domain or system which interprets them. For
  example:

     my_service.category    = "COMPILE" - good
     other_service.critical = "1"       - good

     important = "1"                    - bad; important to who/what system?
     is_compile = "yes"                 - bad; what will interpret this?
                                        - should other recipes copy this key?

  The "luci." prefix is reserved for LUCI's own use.
  The key and value must be utf-8 and not exceed 256/1024 bytes each.
  Neither key nor value can be empty.

  # step_summary_text, step_text and links
  These three properties are combined to populate the `summary_markdown` field
  of the Buildbucket Step.

  `step_summary_text` and `step_text` are used, verbatim, as the first and/or
  second paragraphs of the markdown.

  Links are a simple mapping of link name to a URL. This implementation will
  replace spaces in links with '%20', but does no other URL processing. Links
  are added to the `summary_markdown` by turning them into the final paragraph
  as a bullet list.
