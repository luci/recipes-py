// The number of edges/groups needed to resolve this EdgeGroup is dictated by

// sub-groups to be resolved. With a threshold of 1, any edge or sub-group will
// resolve this EdgeGroup, etc.

  //
  //     { edges: [a, b, c], groups: [GROUP], threshold: 2}

  //   * a b
  //   * b c
  //   * a c
  //   * a GROUP
  //   * b GROUP
  //   * c GROUP
  //
  // Setting this to `1` effectively means 'the first resolved entry in
  // edges or groups resolves this group' (effectively making this an OR).
  //
  // A value greater than one could be useful if you want to depend on the first
  // N of multiple possible edges.
  //
  // A zero threshold will be normalized to `unset`.
  // A negative threshold is an error.

  // easily identify which branch of the edge tree was resolved.
  //
  // `resolution` will be set once the `threshold` is met - this means that some
  // `edges` and `groups` may still be unresolved.
  //
  // Until the node is FINAL, the orchestrator will keep propagating all edges
  // in order to allow you to quickly read the state of the dependencies.
  //
  // To figure out what edges caused an EdgeGroup to be unblocked, compare the
  // timestamp of this resolution to the resolutions in `groups` and/or `edges`.
  // Groups and edges which are resolved after `resolution.at` were not included
  // in the original event which resolved this EdgeGroup.
  //
  // For example, say this EdgeGroup has edges A, B, and C, with a threshold of
  // 2. A and B both become resolved, and so this EdgeGroup will have its
  // resolution set as well. At this point, C is still unresolved.
  //
  // At a later point, C becomes resolved, which will leave this EdgeGroup with
  // all three of its edges resolved - however C's resolution time will be after
  // the resolution time of this EdgeGroup.
  //
  // Note that an EdgeGroup can be resolved with `satisfied = false` if the
  // Orchestrator can prove that no additional evolution of `edges` and `groups`
  // could ever satisfy this EdgeGroup. For example, if `threshold` is set to 5 and
  // this EdgeGroup has 5 entries, one of which is marked as `satisfied
  // = false`, then we know this EdgeGroup must also be unsatisfiable.
