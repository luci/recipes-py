// Dependencies represents a group of edges (the predicate) needed to unblock
// a containing node (a Check or a Stage), as well as timestamps and
// satisfaction of those edges, and finally an overall assessment of the
// resolution of the predicate.
//
// During PLANNING, the `edges` and `predicate` fields are mutable. These
// contain all dependency targets and any criteria for them, plus the boolean
// logic of which subset of these edges are necessary to unblock the node. The
// orchestrator will convert WriteNodesRequest.DependencyGroup into `edges` and
// `predicate` for the client.
//
// As soon as the containing node is PLANNED, the orchestrator will begin
// tracking resolution of the edges. As they are resolved, these 'resolution
// events' are recorded to the the `resolution_events` field.
//
// Finally, once enough resolution events are present such that the `predicate`
// Group can be resolved, the orchestrator will set the `resolution` field.

  // A Group forms a boolean logic expression of edge satisfiability (e.g. `(A
  // && B) || C`). In the basic case with `threshold` unset, a Group is an `AND`
  // of all contained edges/groups. With threshold == 1, a Group is an `OR` of
  // all contained edges/groups.

    // be satisfied (effectively 'AND' of edges and groups).

    // Group.
    //
    // Setting threshold to `1` effectively means 'the first satisfied entry in
    // edges or groups satisfies this group' (effectively making this an OR).
    //
    // A value greater than `1` could be useful if you want to depend on the
    // first N of multiple possible edges.

    // For example, if this Group is
    //
    //    { edges: [a, b, c], groups: [GROUP], threshold: 2 }

    //
    // NOTE: It is possible for a Group in `Dependencies.satisfied` to contain
    // more edges/groups than `threshold` if all of those Edges were satisfied
    // at the time the Dependencies were resolved.
    //
